Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Olympics Data Analysis project! Here, you will find a comprehensive exploration of the rich and diverse world of the Olympic Games through data-driven analysis.

Using SQL as my primary tool, I delved into the Kaggle Olympics dataset to unearth intriguing patterns, trends, and insights. Leveraging a range of SQL operators, clauses, and functions, I conducted a thorough examination of various aspects, including medal counts, athlete demographics, sports participation, and more.
